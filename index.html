      <h2>Madrid, Spain</h2>
      <img src="images/Madrid.jpg" alt="Plaza de España">
      <p>It is the largest city of Spain and, at 655 m (2,100 ft) above sea level, the second highest capital in Europe (after the Andorran capital Andorra la Vella). It is the second largest city in the European Union. As it is the capital city, Madrid is where the monarch lives and also where the government meets.</p>
